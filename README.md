A project I did to solve a problem I had in my current job. 
I work as a typist and I had a problem: when I had to check sedex 10 and sedex 12, the official "Correios" website blocked me when I had a large amount to check and I had to check them one by one.
I created this application to check against a list, with a fixed representative and a list of recipients.
I couldn't implement it because my company wouldn't release the API, but that's part of it!
